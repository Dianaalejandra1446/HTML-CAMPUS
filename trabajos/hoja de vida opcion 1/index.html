            <p id="texto">As a fullstack developer, I have had the opportunity to participate in the development of various software projects. I have worked with different technologies and frameworks both in the backend and in the frontend.
            On the frontend, I've worked with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I've built interactive and optimized user interfaces, implementing features like user authentication, dynamic forms, and real-time updating.
            As a junior Java backend developer, I have had the opportunity to work on various projects where I have had to apply my knowledge of Java and other related technologies.
            
            During my experience, I have been responsible for developing and maintaining the business logic of different applications using the Java programming language and the Spring framework.
            
            In addition, I have had the opportunity to work in a team, collaborating with other developers and following good software development practices such as version control and unit testing.
            
            I have also participated in the design of software architectures, making sure to create scalable, efficient and easy-to-maintain solutions.
            
            During my experience as a junior Java backend developer, I have learned to solve problems efficiently, to work in multidisciplinary teams and to adapt quickly to new technologies and projects.</p>
